HOW TO RUN STOCKPILOT AI (STEP-BY-STEP)

Follow the steps exactly in this order.
Do not skip any step.

⸻

PREREQUISITES

Before starting, make sure:
	•	Python 3.10+ is installed
	•	Android device or emulator is running
	•	USB debugging is enabled (for physical device)
	•	Droidrun is installed and configured
	•	Required Python dependencies are installed using requirements.txt

⸻

STEP 1: OPEN TERMINAL IN PROJECT FOLDER

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Open the terminal and ensure you are inside the project directory that contains:
	•	run_agent.ps1
	•	capture_to_json.py
	•	analyze_stock.py

If needed, navigate to the folder manually using the terminal.

⸻

STEP 2: RUN THE ANDROID AGENT

Run the agent script:
	•	This step launches the Android automation
	•	The agent opens Chrome
	•	Navigates to Screener
	•	Searches for the target stock (e.g., Infosys)
	•	Displays stock fundamentals on screen

Important:
	•	Do NOT close the Android device or emulator
	•	Leave it running after this step completes

This step is responsible for fetching stock data visually from the mobile app.

⸻

STEP 3: CAPTURE DATA INTO JSON

Run the data capture script.

What this step does:
	•	Reads on-screen or extracted stock data
	•	Processes the values
	•	Creates a structured JSON file named stock_data.json

After completion, confirm that:
	•	stock_data.json exists in the project folder

⸻

STEP 4: RUN FINAL STOCK ANALYSIS

Run the analysis script.

What this step does:
	•	Reads data from stock_data.json
	•	Applies analysis logic
	•	Produces a final stock verdict

Expected output:
	•	Display of captured stock data
	•	A clear analysis result (example: STRONG FUNDAMENTALS)

This is the final output of the pipeline.

⸻

EXECUTION FLOW (IMPORTANT)

Always follow this exact order:
	1.	Run agent automation (Android UI opens and shows stock data)
	2.	Capture data into JSON
	3.	Analyze stock and generate verdict

Skipping or reordering steps will break the pipeline.

⸻

IF SOMETHING FAILS

If you encounter an error, share only:
	•	The step number (1, 2, 3, or 4)
	•	The exact error message shown in the terminal

No screenshots needed unless asked.

⸻

FINAL STATUS AFTER SUCCESSFUL RUN

After completing all steps, you will have:
	•	Autonomous mobile agent execution
	•	Structured stock data in JSON format
	•	Automated stock analysis output
	•	A complete, hackathon-ready agentic pipeline
