STOCKPILOT AI
Agentic Mobile Stock Research Assistant
(Built with Droidrun + Mobilerun Cloud)

----------------------------------------------------

ONE-LINE SUMMARY
StockPilot AI is an autonomous mobile agent that performs end-to-end stock research directly inside real Android finance apps and converts on-screen data into structured JSON — without using APIs.

----------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM
Stock research on mobile apps is highly manual:
- Analysts must open apps, search stocks, navigate multiple screens
- Data is locked inside UI and not accessible via APIs
- This process is slow, repetitive, and error-prone

----------------------------------------------------

SOLUTION
StockPilot AI automates this entire workflow using a mobile-native AI agent.

The agent behaves like a human analyst:
- Opens real Android stock market apps
- Searches for a user-specified stock (e.g., Infosys)
- Navigates app screens autonomously
- Reads and captures on-screen financial data
- Outputs structured JSON for further analysis

----------------------------------------------------

CLEAR USE CASE
Use Case: Automated Mobile Stock Research (B2B)

Scenario:
A financial analyst needs quick stock data from mobile apps without manual navigation.

Flow:
1. User runs the StockPilot AI agent
2. Agent opens the finance app and searches the stock
3. Navigates through key sections (overview, price, metrics)
4. Extracts visible data from UI
5. Saves structured stock data as JSON

Result:
A 10–15 minute manual task is completed automatically in seconds.
